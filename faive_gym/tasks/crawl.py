"""
not a serious task, just intended as an example of
- how to make a custom task that is derived from the RobotHand class
- how to create environments where the robot hand doesn't have a fixed base

The robot hand learns to crawl on the floor like a horror film - except it doesn't even learn to crawl right now, see if you can make it work...
Before running, manually delete the "base" mesh in the MJCF file, since the fingers won't even touch the ground that much with the base.
