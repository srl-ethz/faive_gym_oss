# in-hand rotation of a sphere around a fixed axis
# targeted towards sim2real;
# - uses asymmetric observations where the actor only receives proprioceptive measurements
# - use lower control frequency
# - a lot of noise in the observations, action, and domain randomization
# - the task is rather sensitive to the random seed, try with 3 or 4 and use the best result?
